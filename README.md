The project aims to demonstrate a practical and efficient solution for converting human
motion into electrical energy. This system not only promotes sustainable energy
practices but also showcases the potential for integrating microcontrollers and wireless
communication modules in renewable energy systems.

The specific objectives of the project include developing a hardware setup that includes
the piezo electric sensors, PIC microcontroller, rechargeable battery, bluetooth module
and necessary supporting components. Writing software code to interface with the
piezoelectric sensor,PIC microcontroller and bluetooth and process it for display
on mobile screen. Ensuring adequate amount of voltage generation to meet the
requirements of the intended applications. Exploring additional features, such as
impulse to voltage unit conversion, setting up of voltage thresholds, and data logging,

to enhance the functionality of the system. Optimizing the system design for cost-
effectiveness and ease of use, making it suitable for a range of environments and

applications. By addressing these objectives, the project aims to provide a voltage
provider from easily available form of energy that can be utilized in various settings,
including home, office, and other public gathering environments. The system should
offer reliable amount of voltage for practical uses like charging of mobile or other
electronic gadgets etc.
